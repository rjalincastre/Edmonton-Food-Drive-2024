# Edmonton-Food-Drive-2024

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing food donation collection processes in Edmonton, Alberta. Using machine learning and data visualization, the goal is to enhance the efficiency of resource allocation, improve route planning, and predict donation patterns for future planning.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Addressed data inconsistencies, merged multiple datasets, and prepared data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified trends, outliers, and patterns to gain actionable insights.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed machine learning models for:
  - Predicting total donation bags collected.
  - Estimating time spent on routes.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Created dynamic Tableau dashboards for stakeholder presentations.
- **Route Mapping Application**: Automated the generation of optimized routes for volunteers.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Visualization Tool**: Tableau
- **Deployment Tools**: Gradio, Hugging Face, Hugging Chat, Tableau, Microsoft Office

## Results
### Key Insights:
- Identified top-performing wards (e.g., Crawford Plains, Lee Ridge).
- Predicted annual donation growth of ~2% over the next five years.

### Model Performance:
- **Donation Prediction**: R² = 0.98 (Polynomial Regression).
- **Time Prediction**: R² = 0.88 (Decision Tree).

## Future Improvements
- Integrate real-time data for dynamic predictions.
- Expand route mapping features for real-time tracking.
- Enhance dashboards with more interactivity.
